        <h5 id="1" class="my-3 py-2 text-center">Precontractual Idea Protection and Liability</h5>
       <p class="my-4 text-justify text-wrap">
        Few years ago, our colleagues wrote:<br><br>
        
        “For decades, there has been substantial uncertainty as to the circumstances under which the law will impose liability when the parties have had some negotiations, but had not reached agreement on a fully binding contract, and one of the parties refuses to go further. The law’s confusion is partly due to the scholars’ failure to recover the law in action governing precontractual liability issues. ” (Schwartz, Alan; Scott, Robert E, Precontractual Liability and Preliminary Agreements // Harvard Law Review, vol. 120, no. 3 (2007), pp. 661-707).<br><br>
        
        “Precontractual liability is not harmonised in EU law. German author Jehring had the immense influence on the development of precontractual liability doctrine. Almost all EU countries adopt precontractual liability, with the only exception of common law countries. However, models adopted greatly differ in defining the legal nature of the precontractual liability while an overall majority agrees that the extent of damages should only cover reliance interest. The only exception is Dutch law which considers that expectation interest should also be awarded. Analysed non-obligatory legal sources The Principles of European contract law (PECL) and Model Rules of Draft Common Frame of Reference (DCFR) adopted substantially the same rules for precontractual liability. These texts carefully left outside the explicit answer as to whether parties may seek reliance and expectation interest. It is left to legal doctrine to answer this question and for now it is considered that only reliance interest may be sought.” (Braut Filipović, Mihaela; Tomulić Vehovec, Marjeta, Precontractual liability in EU and Croatian law // HARMONIUS Journal of Legal and Social Studies in South East Europe, 1 (2012), 1; pp. 13-32)<br><br>
        
        All of those is pretty understandable, but where is use of it in IT sector? What is the possible value of damage for IT expert if the contract is not concluded? What about shared ideas during the negotiations? Is there any value for shared idea? How can someone be protected of misuse of precontractual negotiations? We understand the value of ideas and we can rise protection against “wasting ideas” to maximum level.   </p>
      
      <h5 id="2" class="my-3 py-2 text-center">Project dynamic-plan negotiations</h5>
      <p class="my-4 text-justify text-wrap">
        The two major components of any IT project is it's scope and time limit for whole project or some parts of it. For project scope, please find our article beneath "Prevention of Investor/Implementer misunderstandings". Time limit can be set for whole project or for some parts of it, or both. It is common for time limits to be set in both directions (investors - implementer). Investors should be fast and precise in pushing their remarks, and implementers should be quick-witted. But what if there is so many remarks which should be implemented that project will breach the time limit? Who is guilty for delays: investor who had many (mostly unreasonable demands), or implementer who couldn't imagine what kind of requests she/he will be dealing with? We can protect any project of making such and similar questions. </p>

       <h5 id="3" class="my-3 py-2 text-center">Prevention of Investor/Implementer misunderstandings  </h5>
       <p class="my-4 text-justify text-wrap">
   Investor/Implementer misunderstandings are very common. Is that a fact? If the implementer is outsourcing branch for some company who is main contractor and who manage whole project, probably such thing as misunderstanding will never occur. But, if you are dealing with the investor, usually there is no project which didn't deal with at least one problem or disagreement. The most popular topic between investors and implementers in the field of disagreements is scope breach or imprecise tasks. Hours and hours of work can be wasted if the tasks are not precise. Probably, the most bizarre example is I-Softyn vs Elo-medics TS case. I-Softyn was IT company who was making web application for Elo-medics. There was no negotiations between the parties. Elo-medics needed software which will be able to manage big buyers requests (products, prices, different countries, importers, exporters ...).<br><br> I-Softyn made their offer but they didn't put any explanations about database technology which should be implemented. Elo-medics, also, didn't emphasize any technology which they requested. There was one sentence in the contract: "I-Softyn is obliged to fabricate software according the written request of Elo-medics within the 6 months ... " When Elo-medics sent first written request, I-Softyn realized that it can not produce software for price per hour they initially set by contract. Elo-medics requested technologies which are more expensive on the market that I-Softyn was initially willing to offer for that price. These days it is hard to believe that any company or any attorney at law will make such oversight, but still there is plenty of misunderstandings between parties. Investors usually are not modest in their requests, especially if there are no detailed project plans made by expert. It is common that they can no realize that every accessorial request need new engagement of programmers (more costs for company). If the company rejects to fulfill requests, the client is not satisfied, and vice versa. So how to make things right? <br><br>
  More sophisticated are scope misunderstandings Where are the boundaries of contract obligations for implementers? Who needs to do some work (needs to spent hours) if the contract is not telling anything of that matter? <br><br>
  If you have good contract, even if those occurs, you can be relaxed.    </p>
     
        <h5 id="4" class="my-3 py-2 text-center">Trade Secrets and Confidentiality</h5>
        <p class="my-4 text-justify text-wrap">
          Protection of competitive advantage and severely action to prevent damage when a breach of confidence occurs is very interesting topic for our practice. Confidential information is information that is not generally known to the public. A trade secret is information that is not generally known within the industry and has commercial value to a business, such as a technique or method. There is no such thing as registering confidential information or trade secrets. So, how can we help then? We can advice you to take measures against your employess, coworkers, partners, potential clients. If those measures are regularly taken, you can consider yourself protected.   </p>
      
         <h5 id="5" class="my-3 py-2 text-center">IT Contracts & Software Licensing</h5>
         <p class="my-4 text-justify text-wrap">
          How many times did you ask yourself if your contract is as good as it should be to protect your interest. Of course, lawyers are making contracts for you, but many times they didn't have a clue about what you were talking. So, these situations were managed: 1) you were client and lawyer and the real lawyers just put into contract norms your thoughts (which is very bad idea); or 2) lawyers engaged extra consultant, usually programmer who tried to explain them what you are talking about (our values extremely disagree with such practice). If you are lawyer and programmer, you do not need lawyer, so, dear colleague, we will be glad to change our experiences with you. Otherwise, if you are programmer who need our service, you are our client and we will do our best to understand you. We do not need extra consultants to understand your requests, they can not know better what are your needs. So what can we offer? We have special division of lawyers who are very common with some programming. They were taking special courses about: HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, PHP, Javascript, Jquery, Ajax, and they have lot of experience in IT project managing and support. So contact us to check how good we are. </p>
     
          <h5 id="61" class="my-3 py-2 text-center">Privacy & Data protection</h5>
          <p class="my-4 text-justify text-wrap">
            "The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and is designed to:<br>
            Harmonize data privacy laws across Europe,
            Protect and empower all EU citizens data privacy
            Reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy.
            GDPR reshapes the way in which sectors manage data, as well as redefines the roles for key leaders in businesses, from Chief Information Officer (CIO) to Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). CIOs must ensure that they have watertight consent management processes in place, whilst CMOs require effective data rights management systems to ensure they don’t lose their most valuable asset – data. (Source: https://eugdpr.org/)"<br><br> The point is that the GDPR’s application is more about who you are targeting rather than where your business is based. Internet has no barriers. Even if you based your business in US, but you are dealing with EU customers, you’ll need comply with GDPR. We can help about compliance procedures.   </p>
